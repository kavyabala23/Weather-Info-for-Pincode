# Weather-Info-for-Pincode
1) Created an api to get the weather details from OpenWeatherMap API
2) When user gives the pincode and date the latitute and longitute is extracted from Geocoding API and then with this details we get weather details from OpenWeatherMap API
3) The output from api is stored in database as text but while getting as an output it is parsed and shown
4) Used AOP for validating whether the pincode is 6 digit long
